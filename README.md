```SQL
Select * from bike_buyers$ 

with duplicate_CTE as (
select ID,[Marital Status],Gender,Income,Children,Education,Occupation,[Home Owner],
Cars,[Commute Distance],Region,Age,[Purchased Bike],row_number() over (partition by ID,[Marital Status],Gender,Income,Children,
Education,Occupation,[Home Owner],Cars,[Commute Distance],Region,Age,[Purchased Bike] order by ID)AS DUPCOUNT FROM bike_buyers$
)
delete from duplicate_CTE WHERE DUPCOUNT > 1

1 select COUNT(ID) AS Total_bikes from bike_buyers$

2 select [Purchased Bike],SUM(CASE when Gender = 'M' THEN 1 else 0 end) as Males,SUM(CASE when Gender = 'F' THEN 1 else 0 end)AS
Females from bike_buyers$ group by [Purchased Bike]

3 select SUM(CASE when Occupation = 'Skilled Manual' THEN 1 else 0 end) as [skilled manual],SUM(CASE when Occupation = 'Professional' THEN 1 else 0 end)AS
Professional,sum(CASE when Occupation='Clerical' then 1 else 0 end)as Clerical,sum(CASE WHEN Occupation='Manual' then 1 else 0 end)as Manual,
sum(CASE when Occupation = 'Management' then 1 else 0 end)as management from bike_buyers$ 

4 select [Purchased Bike],SUM(CASE when [Marital Status] = 'M' THEN 1 else 0 end) as Married,SUM(CASE when [Marital Status] = 'S' THEN 1 else 0 end)AS

5 select SUM(CASE when Age < 30 THEN 1 else 0 end) as young ,SUM(CASE when Age between 30 and 45 THEN 1 else 0 end)AS Adult
,sum(CASE when Age >45  then 1 else 0 end)as old from bike_buyers$

 6 select [Purchased Bike],SUM(CASE when [Commute Distance] = '0-1 Miles' THEN 1 else 0 end) AS [0-1 Miles],SUM(CASE when [Commute Distance] = '1-2 Miles' THEN 1 else 0 end)AS [1-2 Miles], Sum(CASE when [Commute Distance]= '2-5 Miles' then 1 else 0 end) as [2-5 Miles], SUM(CASE when [Commute Distance] = '5-10 Miles' then 1 else 0 end)
 As [5-10 Miles], SUM(CASE when [Commute Distance]='10+ Miles' then 1 else 0 end) as [10+ Miles] from bike_buyers$ group by [Purchased Bike]
  
 7 select Education,sum(Income) as income from bike_buyers$ Group by Education order by income

 8  select [Purchased Bike],[Marital Status],sum(CASE WHEN Region = 'Europe' then 1 else 0 end) as europe , sum(CASE WHEN Region = 'Pacific' then 1 else 0 end) as 
  Pacific, sum(CASE when Region = 'North America' then 1 else 0 end ) as [North America]from bike_buyers$ group by [Purchased Bike],[Marital Status]

```
